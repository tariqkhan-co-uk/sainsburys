* I have catered for ALL devices by implementing fully responsive.
* Clicking on the menu will display additional menu entries. Although, not implemented, you can have the menu close when clicking anywhere other than the menu by implementing a 'back to top' link, which has height and width set to 100% and positioned below the menu when the navigation target is active.
* I have not used javascript.

* Chrome
* Firefox
